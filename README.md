# Overview

In this repository, we are attempting to create a platformer game in three months. Doing this will improve our skills in project management and will provide an opportunity to learn how to use Unreal Engine. 

In this platformer game, the user destroys a number of enemies in an amount of time. The enemies are the soccer balls. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the player has won the level and the amount of time that the user was playing is recorded.
