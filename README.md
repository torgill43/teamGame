# Overview
As a team, we created a side-scrolling platformer game in three months. Doing this helped improve our skills in project management and provided an opportunity to learn how to use Unreal Engine. This project allowed us to collaborate as a team of 6 developers to learn how to effectively communicate and accomplish individual aspects of the project. 

Game description: 
The main player navigates on 2D plane and moves on the y-axis with the goal of destroying enemies along the way. The enemies are destroyed when the player collides with them.

Below is a YouTube link to our project walkthrough and another for a demonstration of the gameplay:
